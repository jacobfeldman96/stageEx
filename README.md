Stage Coin Defi Exchange

The following repo contains a fully functioning DeFi exchange ready for Ethereum Mainnet or Binance Smart Chain deployment. The idea behind stageEx is for the token, Stage Coin, to be used as a single currency for performers around the world! Any travelling performer is used to dealing with the headaches of banks and multiple currencies. With stageEx, one can transfer their Ether into Stage Coin and send Stage Coin to anyone with a metamask wallet!

ToDo: Fork an algorithm to peg Stage Coin to the USD.
